## Tips for Effective Collaboration

### For Project Managers
- Establish clear communication cadences early
- Leverage specialized roles to distribute coordination work
- Ensure role responsibilities don't overlap or create gaps
- Regularly check in on cross-role collaboration effectiveness

### For All Roles
- Respect role boundaries while being flexible when needed
- Communicate proactively, especially on blockers or risks
- Share context and insights across roles
- Default to transparency and over-communication
- Seek input from relevant roles before major decisions

### Small Teams
When team size is limited, roles can be combined:
- Project Manager + Risk Coordinator
- Project Manager + Release Manager
- Agile Coach + Scrum Master (if applicable)
- Stakeholder Representative may be shared across projects

Document which roles are combined and ensure responsibilities are clear.
