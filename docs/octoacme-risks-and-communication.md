# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

The **Risk Coordinator** maintains the risk register and ensures regular updates. In smaller projects, this role may be filled by the Project Manager.

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution (facilitated by Risk Coordinator)
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood (Risk Coordinator leads assessment)
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans (owners assigned by Risk Coordinator and PM)
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status (Risk Coordinator tracks progress)

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status

The **Stakeholder Representative** manages stakeholder engagement and ensures consistent communication. They work closely with the Project Manager to align on messaging and timing.
